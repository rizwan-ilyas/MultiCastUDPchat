# MultiCast Chat Application

"Lets Talks" is a simple Multi-threaded Application for a group chat written in core java.
Its implementation is done using MultiCast Sockets and swing for Ghraphical User Interface.

The code is trivial, but there is one interesting detail to note. As it is Muli-threaded, so for communication between many group users you need to run one server and many clients users on different threads at a time.
